## Project Overview
This project is a simple web page layout designed to resemble a social network post page for **Switter**. It includes:

- A styled header with a logo and user profile picture.
- A central text input area where users can write their post, with a placeholder text and a character limit.
- Two interactive buttons, **Submit** and **Cancel**, that change color on hover.
- The layout is centered and responsive, with clean design elements and consistent styling across the page.

The page is built using **HTML** and **CSS**, and demonstrates the use of flexbox for alignment and positioning, along with basic CSS effects for hover interactions.
